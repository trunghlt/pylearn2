    # Detailed notes:
    # This modification of setup.py is designed to prevent two problems
    # novice users frequently encountered:
    # 1) Novice users frequently used "git clone" to get a copy of Pylearn2,
    # then ran setup.py install, then would use "git pull" to get a bug fix
    # but would forget to run "setup.py install" again.
    # 2) Novice users frequently used "sudo" to make an "installed" copy of
    # Pylearn2, then try to use the tutorials in the "scripts" directory in
    # the "installed" copy. Since the tutorials are then in a directory owned
    # by root and need to create files in the local directory, some users
    # would run the tutorials using "sudo". Besides being dangerous, this
    # created additional problems because "sudo" does not just run the script
    # with root privileges, it actually changes the user to root, and thus
    # pylearn2-related environment variables configured in the user's
    # .bashrc would no longer be available.
    # Installing only in development mode avoids both problems because there
    # is now only a single copy of the code and it is stored in a directory
    # editable by the user.
    # Note that none of the Pylearn2 installation documentation recommends
    # using setup.py install or pip. Most of the Pylearn2 developers just
    # obtain Pylearn2 via git clone and then add it to their PYTHONPATH
    # manually.

# Because many people neglected to run the pylearn2/utils/setup.py script
# separately, we compile the necessary Cython extensions here but because
# Cython is not a strict dependency, we issue a warning when it is not
# available.
